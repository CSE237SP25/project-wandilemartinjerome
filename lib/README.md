# JUnit Testing Setup

## JUnit Libraries
This repository includes the following JUnit libraries:
- junit-4.13.2.jar
- junit-jupiter-api-5.9.1.jar
- hamcrest-core-1.3.jar

These libraries are used for running the tests in the `src/tests` directory.

## Running Tests
You can run the tests using the provided scripts:
- Windows: `run_tests.bat`
- Unix/Linux/Mac: `run_tests.sh`

These scripts will compile both the main application and the test files, and then run all the tests.

## Running Tests in Eclipse
If you're using Eclipse, you can also run the tests directly in the IDE:
1. Open the project in Eclipse
2. Right-click on any test file in the `src/tests` directory
3. Select "Run As > JUnit Test"

Eclipse will automatically handle all JUnit dependencies for you.
